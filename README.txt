This zip file contains the following item:

	(1) MyNetwork.py: this is the basic architecture of the model I built.
	(2) train.py: this is the training file that uses the ResNet34.
        (3) test.py: this is the test file that make prediction of the testing set, but load data with the checkpoint.pth, which contains all parameter values.
 	(4) test(v2).py: this is another version of the testing code, but load the model directly instead of loading the checkpoint.
	(5) image_hw3.pdf: this is the report contains all the information and results of my experiment.
	(6) FinalModel: this is the final model I built, which can be directly imported to make prediction.
	(7) checkpoint.pth: this is the checkpoint file that contains all the parameters setup of the model, which can be directly loaded to the model
